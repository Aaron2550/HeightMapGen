# HeightMapGen
A height map generator with GUI which generates you a height map with corrosponding blend map.  
***Ignore the german commit titles, Visual Studio likes to just push out a commit without asking me what the title should be.***

## Requirements
This requires .NET Framework 4.7.2 and a display (duh) unless... you manage to use it wihtout the GUI ... i guess?

## Screenshots
There are currently no screenshots.

## License
You can do whatever the heck you want with this code. But rather than making your own better version,  
i'd be happy if you just open a pull request to improve upon my cursed code.

This uses the [OpenSimplex2](https://github.com/KdotJPG/OpenSimplex2) library.
